# Cartoonify
This repository is For Converting Image into cartoon image project.
This contain two folders one with name Cartoonify_Streamlit and Another one with name Cartoonify.

Let's talk about cartoonify first.
In cartoonify you need to specify the path of image you want to convert and code will Handle the rest. It will also save the converted image, but make sure to rename it before converting another Image as it overwrite the previous one if name not changed.

Now about Cartoonify_Streamlit Folder.
In this folder code was similar to the previous one, but converting image is not in the perfect color. Image converetd will not be saved, and you have the option to directly upload the image and convert it.
However the uploaded image will be saved in the Saved Image folder.

As a new coder many can get benefit from small projects like this, you can improve it and build a better version and merge it back, this will also help you to understand how to contribute.
You can star and share the repository so that many new coders can get benefit from the same.

# Some suggestions for contribution are:
1. You can find how to save the converted file in Cartoonify_Streamlit.
2. You can describe new features like convert image into pencil sketch, and many more.
3. You can also write a document which tells the use of different functions of code.
